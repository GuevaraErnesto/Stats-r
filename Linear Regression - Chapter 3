In augment() the .hat is the leverage. Datapoints with height leverage might may or may not affect the regression line.
If it does, it's called influential.
High leverage + High residual = Influence (Cooks distance)

The leverage of an observation in a regression model is defined entirely in terms of the distance of that observation 
from the mean of the explanatory variable. That is, observations close to the mean of the explanatory variable have low leverage, 
while observations far from the mean of the explanatory variable have high leverage. 
Points of high leverage may or may not be influential.

How to obtain the coefficient of determination in R:
We apply the lm function to a formula that describes the variable z by the variable y, 
and save the linear regression model in a new variable x.lm.

> x.lm = lm(eruptions ~ waiting, data=faithful)
Then we extract the coefficient of determination from the r.squared attribute of its summary.

> summary(x.lm)$r.squared 
[1] 0.81146


### Obtain the RMSE 

x.sum = summary(x)
x.sum$sigma
