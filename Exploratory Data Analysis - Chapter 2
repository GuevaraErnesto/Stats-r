### Exploring categorical data ###

Getting to know categories inside a variable:

levels(dataframe$factorvariable)

Checking two factors at the same time (2-way contingency table):

table(dataframe$factorvariable, dataframe$factorvariable)

Dropping useless levels:

new_dataframe <- dataframe %>%
  filter(variable != "Level we're dropping") %>%
  droplevels()

# Count vs. proportions #

new_table <â€“ table(dataframe$factorvariable, dataframe$factorvariable)

prop.table(new_table)
prop.table(new_table, 1) # It is used to condition the data by row. The sum is 1.
prop.table(new_table, 2) #  It is used to condition the data by column. The sum is 1.

# Ploting counts 
ggplot(df, aes(x = var, fill = var2)) +
  geom_bar()
  
# Plotting proportions
ggplot(df, aes(x = var, fill = var2)) + 
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  ylab("proportion")

How to create a table of counts for a single variable (Marginal Distribution):

table(dataframe$variable)

How to plot it with a single bar chart:

ggplot(data = dataframe)+
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(variable))
  
Faceting for an additional variable: 

ggplot(data = dataframe) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(variable)) +
  facet_wrap(~align)
  
# Rearranging factors for plots:

dataframe$variable <- factor(dataframe$variable, levels = c("small", "medium", "large"))   # Desired order

# Changing label orientation for better readabilty:

plot+ 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))


### Exploring numerical data ###

Recommended geometries: histogram (geom_histogram), density (geom_density), boxplot (geom_boxplot).

Distribution of one numerical variable: 
Marginal vs. Conditional.

Conditional adds faceting to plots.

ggplot2 + filter()

df %>%
  filter(variable < 2) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = var)) %>%
  geom_histogram()
  
### Facet Grid ###

"Faceting is a valuable technique for looking at several conditional distributions at the same time. 
If the faceted distributions are laid out in a grid, you can consider the association between a variable and two others, 
one on the rows of the grid and the other on the columns."

Plots for 3 variables:

ggplot(dataframe) + 
  geom_density(aes(x = variable)) + 
  facet_grid(variable2 ~ variable3, labeller = label_both)    ### First variable will be represented by rows, second variable will be represented by columns.
                                                              ### Labeller makes it easier to interpret the plots.

When observations are heavily skewed, IQR() is a good measure for variability.
Standard deviation is sensitive to outliers.

### Shapes of a distribution ###

Based on the mode (they are quite self-explanatory): 
- Unimodal.
- Bimodal.
- Multimodal.
- Uniform.

Based on the skew (idem):
- Left-skewed.
- Right-skewed.
- Symmetric.
When heavily skewed, we can use the log() function in order to appreciate the visualization better.
