Let's suppose we have a dataframe -hsb2- with the average reading score of high school students -read- and we want to know the mean, we would use the mean() function.

mean(hsb2$read)

We now want to create a new variable to categorize students according to their reading score in relation to the mean.

hsb2 <- hsb2 %>%
  mutate(read_cat = ifelse (
  read < avg_read,        # logical condition
  "below average",        # if condition is TRUE
  "at or above average"   # if condition is FALSE
  )
  
  
 In a "Yes or No" scenario we can use this syntax.
  
  email50_fortified <- email50 %>%
  mutate(
    number_yn = case_when(
      # if number is "none", make number_yn "no",     
      number == "none" ~ "no", 
      # if number is not "none", make number_yn "yes"
      number != "none" ~ "yes"  
    )
  )
  
  ### OBSERVATIONAL STUDIES AND EXPERIMENTS ### 
  
  In observational studies, since you merely observe, only a correlation can be inferred.
  
  In experiments you randomly assign subjects to various treatments and causation can be inferred.
  
  The difference is the decision maker. In observational studies it's the subject while in experiments is the researcher.
  
  ### RANDOM SAMPLING & RANDOM ASSIGNMENT ###
  
  RS: the selection of subjects for research.
  RA: the random assignment of treatments to subjects.
